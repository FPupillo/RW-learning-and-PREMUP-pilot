## 000. Rescorla Wagner Model R
it containts a function to update the values and prediction error according to RWM. 

001. Rescorla Wagner Model (lambda variable)
In this file, the values of lambda change, so that the reinforcement can be either present or not.

002. Learning rule from Daw 2011. 
It contains a function updating the model according to Daw (2011). It also contains a graphs. 

003. learning rule from Daw 2011, w simulated choice
in this file, I tried to simulate participants' choice, depending on the probabilities of each category. It did not went well, 
because the randomness of the choice dramatically influence the subsequent overal performance (preferred choice for the most probable category)

004. Config file.
Retrieve files per participant and parameter estimation functions (R squared)

005.find parameters minimize Likel.R
In this file, the algorithm to find the likelihood as described by Daw (2011) has been implemented. 

006. estimate parameters for participants phase1
this file estimate parameters by computing R squared. It also print the documents.

007. Analyses Phase1 and plots

008. Performance Phase 2.
Analyse performance participants for phase 2. 

009.
Analyse the choice of participants for medium PE (scene 1, 2, 3) and return values that are above 0.67

010. 
Estimating parameters for participants using maximum likelihood (from Daw, 2011)

011. 
Analyze data phase 2. It also produces plot. 

012. 
computing accuracy at the participant level. It asks to create a dataset per participant

013. 
Analyses of Phase 3. 

014. 
Simulations using actual trials and the Dirichlet Distribution.
